SAVIME is a tool designed for managing simulation data in multidimensional arrays. However, it can be used as a general purpose
in-memory array database and analytical software. In its current form, it is able only to execute very simple operations, such
as: PROJECTIONS, FILTERS BASED ON PREDICATES, CALCULALION OF DERIVED VALUES, SIMPLE AGGREGATIONS, CARTESIAN PRODUCTS AND JOINS BASED ON DIMENSIONS (EXPERIMENTAL).

It is integrated with the catalyst library, thus it is possible to call a catalyst script to be carried out upon an output of a query, if the correct type configuration
for the array structures is set. To do so, SAVIME must be installed with catalyst support.

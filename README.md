# SAVIME

SAVIME (Simulation Analysis and Visualization In MEmory) is a DBMS-like system that stores data in the format of typed multidimensional arrays. It is desgined to help querying and vizualize numerical simulation data. However, it can also be used as an analytical in-memory array database management system. SAVIME is at early development stages, and supports only a handful of operations. But it is already able to perform many tasks, even for large datasets in memory.
